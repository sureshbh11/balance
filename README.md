# balance
The requirement is to build a feature to take in a balance and convert it into denominations (bills/coins). The intent is to convert the balance into the least number of bills/coins. The input balance is expressed as the lowest unit of currency (e.g. pennies for USD). Examples (USD): Given the balance 87, the function will return 3 Quarter, 1 Dime, 2 Penny coins. Given the balance 287, the function will return 2 Dollar, 3 Quarter, 1 Dime, 2 Penny coins.
